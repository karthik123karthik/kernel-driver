## Race Condition
- whenever two process are trying to access same shared resource then the condition arise called race condition.
- whenever there is racecondition there will be inconsistency we will see in the resource so it is very important to avoid the race conditions.

## Atomicity
- it is a condition where one process can execute that at a time(only one call can be made at a time either full or zero).

## FILE TABLE
- there will be one file table which will be specific to a process that contain file descriptor.
- then there will be a open system table which is not process specific. it will have offset, file details and pointer to INode
- then Inode is a datastructure for file which contain info like type, uid, gid, time, address. to know the file Inode info run - stat filename
